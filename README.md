# feedreader-testing
## How does this work?
This project looks into a RSS Feed created by Udacity and displays the test cases using Jasmine.
## How to run the project
1. Download the files from Git from this link:
`https://github.com/marladefensor/feedreader-testing.git`
2. Open up the file `index.html` and the web page should run!
## Where are the tests?
If you scroll past the RSS Feed on `index.html`, the tests can be seen there.
